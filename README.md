# README file for the TEAM project Simple Shell :busts_in_silhouette: :ledger:

We are Tara and Xavier, students from the campus of Holberton in Fr√©jus.

## Description of this project :spiral_notepad: :

In this project it is requested to reproduce a simplified version of the shell. This should work in the terminal to allow typing a command and running it, such as ls or cat + name of file. It should be possible to exit the shell with specific commands like exit.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Requirements of this project :

Here are some main requirements we need to respect while working on this project together :

### :star: General requirements :

- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- Your shell should not have any memory leaks
- No more than 5 functions per file
- All your header files should be include guarded
- Use system calls only when you need to.
- Only some system calls and functions are allowed. (Listed below in the dedicated section)
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

## :rocket:  How to clone, compile and execute our shell :

### :small_orange_diamond: How to clone this repo ?

If you want to give a try to our project, you are very welcome to clone this repo on your computer, using the command git clone and the link in your terminal.

### :small_orange_diamond: How to  compile ?

You can compile this program using this command :

	gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

### :small_orange_diamond: How to execute the program ?

If you want to test our program, you can simply compile and then execute our program with a command like this one :

	/bin/ls

### :small_orange_diamond: How to exit the simple shell program :

Once you tested our program you probably will be looking for the command to use in order to quit the program :

- use control + C
- or exit
- or ctrl + D

### :small_orange_diamond: How to check for memory leaks ? :thinking:

	valgrind + name of the file

## :small_orange_diamond: What will this program return ? 

The program returns 0 on success, or another value on error.


## :small_blue_diamond: How to use the man page of the Simple Shell project ?

In order to read the man page of this project, please use the command below :
